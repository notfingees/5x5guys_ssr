      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>Last Updated: April 1, 2022</h2>

Sunrises LLC. d/b/a In Writing (“In Writing,” “we”, “us”, or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the Personal Data (as defined below) we collect, use, and share in connection with the In Writing website, mobile app, and other software provided on or in connection with our services, as described in our Terms of Service (collectively, the “Service”). “NFT” in this Privacy Policy means a non-fungible token or similar digital item implemented on a blockchain (such as the Ethereum blockchain), which uses smart contracts to link to or otherwise be associated with certain content or data.

    <h3>1. Types of Data We Collect.</h3> “Personal Data” means data that allows someone to identify you individually, including, for example, your name, email address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing. “Anonymous Data” means data, including aggregated and de-identified data, that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data as described below.
    
    <br>

<b>a. Information You Provide Us.</b><br>
When you use our Service, update your account profile, or contact us, we may collect Personal Data from you, such as email address, first and last name, user name, and other information you provide. We also collect your blockchain address, which may become associated with Personal Data when you use our Service.
Our Service lets you store preferences like how your content is displayed, notification settings, and favorites. We may associate these choices with your ID, browser, or mobile device.
If you provide us with feedback or contact us, we will collect your name and contact information, as well as any other content included in the message.
We may also collect Personal Data at other points in our Service where you voluntarily provide it or where we state that Personal Data is being collected.
    
    <br>

    <b>b. Information Collected via Technology.</b><br> As you navigate through and interact with our Service, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns, including:
Information Collected by Our Servers. To provide our Service and make it more useful to you, we (or a third party service provider) collect information from you, including, but not limited to, your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, mobile device ID, blockchain address, wallet type, and date/time stamps.
Log Files. As is true of most websites and applications, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Service, track users\' movements around the Service, and better tailor our Services to our users\' needs. For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Service, it will recognize you and the information can be used to personalize your experience.
Cookies. Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to analyze how users interact with our Service, make improvements to our product quality, and provide users with a more personalized experience.
How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals. Our systems do not currently recognize “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that might enable Users to opt out of tracking on our site.
    <br>
    <b>c. Information Collected from Third-Party Companies.</b><br>We may receive Personal and/or Anonymous Data about you from companies that offer their products and/or services for use in conjunction with our Service or whose products and/or services may be linked from our Service. For example, third-party wallet providers provide us with your blockchain address and certain other information you choose to share with those wallets providers. We may add this to the data we have already collected from or about you through our Service.
<br>
<b>d. Public Information Observed from Blockchains.</b><br> We collect data from activity that is publicly visible and/or accessible on blockchains. This may include blockchain addresses and information regarding purchases, sales, or transfers of NFTs, which may then be associated with other data you have provided to us.
<br>

<h3>2. Use of Your Personal Data.</h3>

<br>
<h3>3. Disclosure of Your Personal Data.</h3> We disclose your Personal Data as described below and as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.

In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, Personal Data may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires our company, business, or assets, that company will possess the Personal Data collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.
<br>
<b>d. Legal Rights.</b> Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Data (as described below), In Writing may disclose Personal Data if it believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary: (a) in connection with any legal investigation; (b) to comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas, warrants, or other legal process served on In Writing; (c) to protect or defend the rights or property of In Writing or users of the Service; and/or (d) to investigate or assist in preventing any violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy, or our Terms of Service.
<br>
<b>e. Other Disclosures.</b> We may also disclose your Personal Data: to fulfill the purpose for which you provide it; for any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide it; or with your consent.
<br>
<h3>4. Third-Party Websites.</h3> Our Service may contain links to third-party websites. When you click on a link to any other website or location, you will leave our Service and go to another site, and another entity may collect Personal Data from you. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for these third-party websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of this Privacy Policy do not apply to these third-party websites or their content, or to any collection of your Personal Data after you click on links to such third-party websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of every website you visit. Any links to third-party websites or locations are for your convenience and do not signify our endorsement of such third parties or their products, content, or websites.
<br>
<h3>5. Third-Party Wallets.</h3> To use our Service, you must use a third-party wallet which allows you to engage in transactions on public blockchains. Your interactions with any third-party wallet provider are governed by the applicable terms of service and privacy policy of that third party.
<br>
<h3>6. Your Choices Regarding Information. </h3>You have several choices regarding the use of information on our Services:
If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to accept Cookies from our Service for any of the purposes described above, then you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting a Cookie from the websites you visit. Consult your browser\'s technical information. If you do not accept Cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Service or all functionality of the Service.
<br>
<h3>7. Data Access and Control.</h3> You can view, access, edit, or delete your Personal Data for certain aspects of the Service via your Settings page. You may also have certain additional rights:
<br>
a. If you are a user in the European Economic Area or United Kingdom, you have certain rights under the respective European and UK General Data Protection Regulations (“GDPR”). These include the right to (i) request access and obtain a copy of your personal data; (ii) request rectification or erasure; (iii) object to or restrict the processing of your personal data; and (iv) request portability of your personal data. Additionally, if we have collected and processed your personal data with your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
<br>
b. If you are a California resident, you have certain rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). These include the right to (i) request access to, details regarding, and a copy of the personal information we have collected about you and/or shared with third parties; (ii) request deletion of the personal information that we have collected about you; and (iii) the right to opt-out of sale of your personal information. As the terms are defined under the CCPA, we do not “sell” your “personal information.”
<br>
c. If you wish to exercise your rights under the GDPR, CCPA, or other applicable data protection or privacy laws, please contact us by using the “Submit a request” link here or at the address provided in Section 13 below, specify your request, and reference the applicable law. We may ask you to verify your identity, or ask for more information about your request. We will consider and act upon any above request in accordance with applicable law. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights.
<br>
d. Notwithstanding the above, we cannot edit or delete any information that is stored on a blockchain, for example the Ethereum blockchain, as we do not have custody or control over any blockchains. The information stored on the blockchain may include purchases, sales, and transfers related to your blockchain address and NFTs held at that address.
<br>
<h3>8. Data Retention.</h3> We may retain your Personal Data as long as you continue to use the Service, have an account with us, or for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. We may continue to retain your Personal Data even after you deactivate your account and/or cease to use the Service if such retention is reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our Terms or other agreements, and/or protect our legitimate interests. Where your Personal Data is no longer required for these purposes, we will delete it.
<br>
<h3>9. Data Protection. </h3> We care about the security of your information and use physical, administrative, and technological safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of information collected through our Service. However, no security system is impenetrable and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems. In the event that any information under our custody and control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take steps to investigate and remediate the situation and, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised.
<br>
a. You are responsible for the security of your digital wallet, and we urge you to take steps to ensure it is and remains secure. If you discover an issue related to your wallet, please contact your wallet provider.
<br>
<h3>10. Minors. </h3>We do not intentionally gather Personal Data from visitors who are under the age of 13. Our Terms of Service require all users to be at least 18 years old. Minors who are at least 13 years old but are under 18 years old may use a parent or guardian\'s In Writing account, but only with the involvement of the account holder. If a child under 13 submits Personal Data to In Writing and we learn that the Personal Data is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible. If you believe that we might have any Personal Data from a child under 13, please contact us by using the “Submit a request” link here or at the address indicated in Section 13 below.
<br>
<h3>11. Users Outside of the United States.</h3> If you are a non-U.S. user of the Service, by visiting the Service and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that your Personal Data may be processed for the purposes identified in the Privacy Policy. In addition, your Personal Data may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your country. By providing your Personal Data, you consent to such transfer.
<br>
<h3>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy.</h3>  This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy at https://inwriting.io/privacy.html. The date the Privacy Policy was last revised is identified at the beginning of this Privacy Policy. You are responsible for periodically visiting our Service and this Privacy Policy to check for any changes.
